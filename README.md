In this assignment what I was asked to do
    1)I used my creativity along with your engine and .json blueprint to make a game of my own creation.

    2)I did run into a few issues that didnt make sense to me because the lines the code was on was layed out the same way as the code around. At line 268, the game starts switching the "v" and "map" for some reason. What I mean is that it onlys expects "v" as an answer instead of the "map." I have looked over this aread of coding at least five times, and I can't seem to figure out why it is doing it in the first place. I have just decided to turn it in.

    3)This was an extended assignment that you allowed. I was eventually able to figure out how to fix the problem I originally had. Although, there is one one more thing I would like to bring up. When the user types in there answers, the game doesnt except answers with spaces for some reason.
